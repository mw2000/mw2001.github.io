    <h4>Hi, I'm Mihir!</h4> I am a sophomore pursuing Computer Engineering at University of California, Davis.
    I'm currently an undergraduate researcher at ExpoLAB UC Davis, researching the applications of Blockchain in
    sustainability and waste management under Prof. Mohammad Sadoghi. This research led me to co-found PlastiCoin,
    a blockchain-based incentivized way of recycling plastic. In addition to this, I also work as a finance associate
    for SacHacks, contacting industry professionals to raise money for the first intercollegiate hackathon in the
    greater Sacramento area.
